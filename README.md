# Kirs_Mikhail_Macwan_Chris_Music_Mixer

## Description

Our team was tasked with creating a fully functional music mixer that allows users to drag and drop sounds into target zones and play music using JavaScript. The concept was to design a vibrant, party-themed page featuring a DJ panel and a speaker to simulate a clubbing atmosphere. During the process, our team was divided into two roles. Kirs Mikhail was responsible for the design, creating an original background, speaker, and DJ panel, as well as writing the HTML and CSS. Chris Macwan handled the JavaScript functionality. We also wrote our original song to the music mixer. Drag the sounds, drop them into the DJ panel and enjoy your party!
